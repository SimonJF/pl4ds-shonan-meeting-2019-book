\biblstarthook{References may be \textit{cited} in the text either by number (preferred) or by author/year.\footnote{Make sure that all references from the list are cited in the text. Those not cited should be moved to a separate \textit{Further Reading} section or chapter.} If the citatiion in the text is numbered, the reference list should be arranged in ascending order. If the citation in the text is author/year, the reference list should be \textit{sorted} alphabetically and if there are several works by the same author, the following order should be used:
\begin{enumerate}
\item all works by the author alone, ordered chronologically by year of publication
\item all works by the author with a coauthor, ordered alphabetically by coauthor
\item all works by the author with several coauthors, ordered chronologically by year of publication.
\end{enumerate}
The \textit{styling} of references\footnote{Always use the standard abbreviation of a journal's name according to the ISSN \textit{List of Title Word Abbreviations}, see \url{http://www.issn.org/en/node/344}} depends on the subject of your book:
\begin{itemize}
\item The \textit{two} recommended styles for references in books on \textit{mathematical, physical, statistical and computer sciences} are depicted in ~\cite{science-contrib, science-online, science-mono, science-journal, science-DOI} and ~\cite{phys-online, phys-mono, phys-journal, phys-DOI, phys-contrib}.
\item Examples of the most commonly used reference style in books on \textit{Psychology, Social Sciences} are~\cite{psysoc-mono, psysoc-online,psysoc-journal, psysoc-contrib, psysoc-DOI}.
\item Examples for references in books on \textit{Humanities, Linguistics, Philosophy} are~\cite{humlinphil-journal, humlinphil-contrib, humlinphil-mono, humlinphil-online, humlinphil-DOI}.
\item Examples of the basic Springer Nature style used in publications on a wide range of subjects such as \textit{Computer Science, Economics, Engineering, Geosciences, Life Sciences, Medicine, Biomedicine} are ~\cite{Cardoso.2016, basic-contrib, basic-online, basic-journal, basic-DOI, basic-mono}.
