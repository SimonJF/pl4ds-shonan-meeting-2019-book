The global appendix of the book goes here.

\section{Section Heading}\label{appendix:A1}

Instead of simply listing headings of different levels we recommend to let every heading be followed by at least a short passage of text. Further on please use the \LaTeX\ automatism (cite, ref, etc.) for all your cross-references and citations.

\subsection{Subsection Heading}\label{appendix:A2}
Instead of simply listing headings of different levels we recommend to let every heading be followed by at least a short passage of text. Further on please use the \LaTeX\ automatism for all your cross-references and citations as has already been described in Sect.~\ref{appendix:A1}.

For multiline equations we recommend to use the \verb|eqnarray| environment.
\begin{eqnarray}
\vec{a}\times\vec{b}=\vec{c} \nonumber\\
\vec{a}\times\vec{b}=\vec{c}
\label{appendix:eq:1}
\end{eqnarray}
